## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### "Column does not exist" error
**Cause:** Database schema not applied
**Fix:** Run `new-features-schema.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor

### "Bucket not found" error
**Cause:** Storage buckets not created
**Fix:** Create 5 buckets in Supabase Storage (Step 2)

### "Permission denied" when uploading
**Cause:** Storage policies missing
**Fix:** Run `storage-policies.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor

### Images upload but don't display
**Cause:** Bucket not public
**Fix:** Storage → Click bucket → Configuration → Toggle "Public" ON

### "New features not working"
**Cause:** Old version of app running
**Fix:** Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R) or clear cache

## ✅ Verification Checklist

After setup, run these SQL queries to verify:

```sql
-- Should return 3 rows (image_url, video_url, gif_url)
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'questions'
AND column_name IN ('image_url', 'video_url', 'gif_url');

-- Should return 5 rows (all buckets)
SELECT name, public FROM storage.buckets;

-- Should return 10 (2 policies per bucket)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM storage.policies
WHERE bucket_id IN ('quiz-images', 'quiz-videos', 'quiz-gifs', 'quiz-backgrounds', 'user-avatars');
```
